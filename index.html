            <p class= "aboutme">Born in Saudi Arabia to two insane, American expats who decided to stick around for the Gulf War. Fun family photo of everyone in gas masks (my sister and I were ages 3 and 5, respectively). Moved back to New Mexico, where I had to explain to visiting classmates, that there is indeed a camel skull in my living room. For high school I got the unique experience of actually attending a military boarding school. After that it’s all even more downhill and not worth writing. 

            <p class= "aboutme">Not fun fact: Was visiting the French side of my family when the infamous Nov 2015 Paris terror attacks occurred. And yes, they live in Paris. </p>
                    
            <p class= "aboutme">I love rock-climbing, reading, a good k-drama, and all things related to food and cats. Seriously, if you’re making pesto with a processor you’re doing it wrong. Get that mortar and pestle, your tastebuds deserve it. </p>
                  
            <p class= "aboutme"> I play guitar and piano badly but with gusto.  </p>
